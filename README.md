# 🧪 Diabetes Prediction with PySpark MLlib

This repository contains code and resources for the **"Data Science: Hands-on Diabetes Prediction with Pyspark MLlib"** course. The project demonstrates how to build a scalable machine learning model using Apache Spark to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on diagnostic attributes from the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset.

## 📊 Dataset

We use the **Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset**, which includes medical diagnostic data for female patients. Each record consists of features such as:

- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- BMI
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age
- Outcome (1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Apache Spark & PySpark
- MLlib (Spark’s machine learning library)
- Pandas, NumPy (for optional local analysis)
- Jupyter Notebook / Databricks (recommended for interactive development)
